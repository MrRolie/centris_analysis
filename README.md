- **Present findings and insights** from Quebec plex market analysis
- **Provide reusable frameworks** for similar real estate analyses
- **Showcase best practices** in data preparation, modeling, and visualization

**Note**: The actual data files are not included due to proprietary restrictions. The code structure and methodology can be adapted for similar datasets.

## üìä Key Features

### Discount Identification System
- Multi-factor scoring based on revenue yield, price per unit, and market comparisons
- Benchmarking against property type and location averages
- Identification of potentially undervalued properties

### Predictive Modeling
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Revenue ‚Üí Price relationship
- **Enhanced Multi-feature Model**: Includes property characteristics, location, age, etc.
- **Random Forest**: Advanced ensemble model for better accuracy
- Model comparison and validation metrics

### Comprehensive Analysis
- Revenue yield calculations and distributions
- Price per unit and price per square foot analysis
- Geographic visualization with interactive maps
- Correlation analysis of key property features

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Mapping**: plotly mapbox

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

### 1. Environment Setup
Copy the example environment file and configure your data paths:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set your data file paths:

```bash
# For macOS users
PLEX_CSV_PATH_MACOS=/Users/YourUsername/path/to/centris_comprehensive_plex_data.csv

# For Windows users  
PLEX_CSV_PATH_WINDOWS=C:\Users\YourUsername\path\to\centris_comprehensive_plex_data.csv
```

### 2. Configuration Management
The project uses a centralized configuration system that automatically:
- Detects your operating system (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Loads the appropriate data path from `.env`
- Provides fallback options for common locations
- Manages project settings (target year, growth rates, random seeds)

Test your configuration:
```python
from utils.config import print_config
print_config()
```

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Educational Review)

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn jupyter step-criterion
```

### Exploring the Methodology

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrRolie/centris_analysis.git
   cd centris_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Review the analysis structure**
